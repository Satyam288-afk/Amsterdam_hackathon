# Sambhaash AI — AI Revenue Recovery

> **DETECT → DIAGNOSE → DECIDE → ACT → RECOVER**

Sambhaash AI is an AI receivables-recovery agent for overdue B2B invoices. It detects revenue at risk, identifies a bounded payment cause, chooses an approved intervention, and executes a multilingual voice or WhatsApp recovery workflow. A valid promise-to-pay pauses outreach; a failed promise, repeated failures, or a high-value invoice trigger controlled human escalation.

## Track 03 demo

The project includes a **clearly labelled fictional, offline-capable demo batch** of nine invoices totalling **₹18,40,000 at risk**. No live database, model, Twilio, Sarvam, or WhatsApp credentials are required for the core Track 03 walkthrough.

1. Open `http://localhost:5173/dashboard/recovery`.
2. Open **Aarav Mehta / INV-2026-1042**: ₹84,500, 18 days overdue, risk 87/100, cause `approval delay`.
3. Execute its approved WhatsApp + payment-link action.
4. Simulate: `Friday ko payment kar denge.` The app records the promise, schedules the next action, and stops automation.
5. Simulate payment confirmation. The case becomes recovered and ₹84,500 is visible as recovered revenue.
6. Open **Benchmark** to compare the calculated Sambhaash workflow with the generic-reminder baseline.

## Bounded workflow rules

- Maximum automated attempts: **3**
- Maximum voice calls per day: **1**
- Stop on payment, valid promise-to-pay, or opt-out
- Escalate after repeated failures, failed promise-to-pay, or high-value invoice
- The LLM may classify or draft text, but backend rules own payment status, limits, and escalation

## Benchmark

The synthetic benchmark is calculated in code from the same fictional records. The baseline is one generic reminder; Sambhaash applies deterministic risk scoring, diagnosis, an approved intervention, and bounded stopping rules. It reports invoices evaluated, amount at risk, recovered amount, recovery rate, average contacts, escalation count, promise count, and net recovered value. It is an assumption model, not a claim about real merchant outcomes.

## Technology reused

React, FastAPI, Supabase/Postgres, LangGraph, the existing scoring and RAG/pgvector paths, Celery/Redis, Twilio, WhatsApp, Whisper, Groq, and Sarvam voice remain part of the architecture. The new recovery module is deliberately small and can map its demo adapter to the existing repository/database layer for production.

## Run the Track 03 demo

```bash
# Backend (from Backend/)
python -m pytest tests/test_recovery_engine.py -q
python scripts/run_recovery_benchmark.py
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload

# Frontend (from Frontend/)
npm install
npm run dev
```

For deployment, configure `CORS_ORIGINS` and `TRUSTED_HOSTS` with the actual frontend and backend hostnames. Wildcard CORS/trusted-host defaults have been removed.

The case page also contains clearly labelled offline simulation controls for
payment confirmation, a Hinglish promise-to-pay, an invoice dispute, payment
failure, and no response. Each outcome is recorded in the case timeline and
evaluated against the same backend recovery policy.

## 🎯 Objective

**Target Users:** Businesses, sales teams, and organizations operating in India that require scalable, localized lead generation and engagement.
**The Pain Point:** Human telecalling has immense manual overhead, suffers from language barriers across India's diverse linguistic landscape, and is limited by working hours.
**The Value Provided:** Sambhaash AI is a premium, state-of-the-art multilingual voice and text conversational AI platform. Powered by an intelligent LLM brain, it interacts with leads via phone calls and WhatsApp, answers context-specific questions from an indexed Knowledge Base, scores leads dynamically, and assigns high-intent clients directly to dedicated Relationship Managers.

### Your Approach:
- **Why you chose this problem:** India's linguistic diversity makes unified communication incredibly difficult. Overcoming language barriers in business outreach can multiply engagement rates tremendously.
- **Key challenges you addressed:** Orchestrating sub-second latency for multilingual voice AI interactions (Speech-to-Text -> LLM generation -> Text-to-Speech) to make phone calls feel natural.
- **Breakthroughs:** Utilizing Sarvam's BulBul V3 for hyper-realistic Indian language synthesis and creating a robust RAG vector lookup during live call sessions to handle dynamic objections.
